Project that aims creating a discord irc-like interface, based on irssi.
This project is not released though, but any changes about it will be commited here.

Feel free to contact me through mail using arhoc@protonmail.com OR by posting an issue.
(No, discord staff, you won't find my discord tag here, so you can leave and cancel other projects)
